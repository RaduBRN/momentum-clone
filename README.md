# Momentum Clone - A Chrome Extension

This project is a clone of the Momentum Chrome Extension, created to practice async/await concepts in JavaScript.

The extension offers a dynamic user experience, changing the background image to a random picture of a road, displaying the current time, weather information based on the user's geolocation, and real-time Bitcoin market information. This application makes use of various APIs and provides a live, intuitive and informative interface for users.

## Features

- Displays the current time, with the time being updated every second.
- The background image is set to a random picture of a road fetched from Unsplash API.
- The weather information of the user's current location is fetched from OpenWeather API and displayed.
- Real-time Bitcoin market information like current price, 24-hour high, and 24-hour low are fetched from CoinGecko API and displayed.

## APIs Used

1. **Unsplash API:** Provides a random image of a road. Using Scrimba's version of the API simplifies the process, as you don't need to register or authenticate the API on your own.
2. **CoinGecko API:** Provides information about Bitcoin like the current price, 24-hour high, and 24-hour low.
3. **OpenWeather API:** Provides weather information based on the user's current location. The Scrimba's version of the API is used here as well.

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
